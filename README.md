# Installation 
When running this app everything should be the same only to add a few applications if you need to. I had trouble running this on my computer, so I used a different one, and it worked fine. Now when it comes to the folder you should open it should be src. That folder contains all of the materials you need in Java to start the app. The other files are just the builds and gradles that came when I booted up Android Studio I barely touched those files but I added it just in case. The last file is the resources files which include the XML files that I used in making the program and a picture to get the background it doesn't have to look the same but it will give you a general idea of what to start with.
